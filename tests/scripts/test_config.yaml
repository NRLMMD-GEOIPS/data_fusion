# Identify and update all instances of @ found within this script appropriately.
#   @package@ should be the name of this repository
#   @datatype@ should reference the datatype you are interested in processing (and will reference the test data
#              repository you set up through https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/template_test_data
#   @datafile@ is the appropriate path to your data files within the test data repo.
#   @readername@ is the appropriate reader associated with your testdataset
#   @productN@ are the products you would like to test.
#   NOTE: imagery_clean preferred to avoid dependencies on external plotting packages for image consistency,
#           though you may change the output format if required for your package testing.
#   NOTE: You can include a TC test case, a global test case, or both.  Just remove the one you don't want,
#           if you only need one or the other.

# Note you may update other parameters within this YAML config as appropriate, or add additional parameters.
# Also - the first time you run your test script using this YAML config, it will prompt you to update your
# test outputs - at that point you can populate the "tests/outputs" directory, and your next run will result
# in a 0 return value.
