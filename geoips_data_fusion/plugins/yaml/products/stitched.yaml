  Stitched products which combine multiple data types over a geographical area.

  Layered products combine multiple products that cover the same region within
  the same image.  Stitched imagery combines multiple data types that cover an
  extended region into a single image by blending the overlap regions between
  data types (ie, geostationary and polar satellites over a global sector)
