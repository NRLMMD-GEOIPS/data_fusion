enhancement:
- title: 'Write data fusion products to database'
  description: |
    Add hooks for writing products to the database! The schema name, table name, and
    classifications are defined in a procflow output config file! Eventually this output
    config file will actually specify the outputs, but for now only enables the database
    hooks! This setup also allows us to re-use the same function used in the
    config_based procflow for writing products to the database!

    Also add support for writing the list of products created by the procflow to a file!
