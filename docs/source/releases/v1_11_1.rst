* Update coverage checker arguments in YAML products

Bug Fixes
=========

Update coverage checker arguments in YAML products
--------------------------------------------------

Pass single desired dataset_name:variable_name to use for coverage checkers in
YAML products (windspeed:windspeed_kts).

Update data_fusion procflow to set the coverage dataset based on
dataset_name:variable_name in the coverage args.
