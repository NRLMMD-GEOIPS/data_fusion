Refactoring Updates
===================

Replace all occurences of ``matplotlib_linear_norm`` to ``linear_norm``
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#504 492 text based interface*

This is a small refactoring PR that was needed due to changes included in #504. Jeremy
and I decided that colormapper ``matplotlib_linear_norm`` wasn't the best name for that
colormapper, as it just applies a ``linear_norm`` algorithm to colormap the data
correctly. It is not inherently just matplotlib-based. We updated all occurences of this
found within data_fusion.

Update Test Scripts and 'data_fusion_procflow' to use 'geoips run data_fusion'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#455: 2024-03-21, CLI Stage Two*

With the new addition of the GeoIPS CLI, we've changed how we call process workflows
(procflows). While ``run_procflow`` and ``data_fusion_procflow`` will still work
(we've supported backwards compatability for this update), we've updated the scripts
to use ``geoips run data_fusion`` instead of ``data_fusion_procflow``. This removes
``--procflow data_fusion`` from scripts as well. We've also modified
``data_fusion_procflow`` to point towards
``geoips.commandline.commandline_interface:main``, as that is how we start a process
workflow from now on.
