* Refactor: Update data_fusion to use 'output_checkers' interface

Refactoring Updates
===================

Update Recenter TC to use the 'output_checkers' interface
---------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#293: 2023-08-24, Create interface for compare outputs*

GeoIPS currently compares output products by using the compare_outputs.py module. This
needed to be converted into an interface so that we could easily compare different
outputs, and eventually extend this functionality to other outputs if they are created
in the future.
