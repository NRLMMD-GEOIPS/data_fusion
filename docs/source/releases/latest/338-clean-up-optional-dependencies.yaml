- description: |
    Some GeoIPS readers include optional dependency statements that are required to read
    certain file formats. While keeping these imports as optional is ok, we should clean
    up the manner in which this is implemented. To do so, we've created a separate
    geoips.testing.context_manager.py script which can handle optional imports scattered
    throughout the GeoIPS codebase. This is essentially replacing our old manner of
    optional dependencies with a new method that keeps things clean.
