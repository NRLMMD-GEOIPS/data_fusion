* Allow returning a single TC storm time rather than full list

Bug fixes
=========

Allow returning a single TC storm time rather than full list
------------------------------------------------------------

Add filter_time=True to the get_area_defs_from_command_line_args
call.  This allows returning only a single TC storm time, rather
than the full list (to mirror how TC sectors are handled in single
source procflow).
