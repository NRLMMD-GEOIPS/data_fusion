bug fix:
- title: 'Add basic hooks for resource tracking and skip area defs with no spatial data'
  description: |
    Add the required hooks for enabling tracking resource usage at specified
    checkpoints. Checkpoints have not been added to the data_fusion procflow, but the
    basic hooks are required for the write_stats_to_database function.

    Also check if the pad_sect_xarrays is an empty dict under get_fused_xarray. This
    occurs when no spatial data exists for the given sector.
