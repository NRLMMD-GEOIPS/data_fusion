Refactoring Updates
===================

Update Test Scripts and 'data_fusion_procflow' to use 'geoips run data_fusion'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#455: 2024-03-21, CLI Stage Two*

With the new addition of the GeoIPS CLI, we've changed how we call process workflows
(procflows). While ``run_procflow`` and ``data_fusion_procflow`` will still work
(we've supported backwards compatability for this update), we've updated the scripts
to use ``geoips run data_fusion`` instead of ``data_fusion_procflow``. This removes
``--procflow data_fusion`` from scripts as well. We've also modified
``data_fusion_procflow`` to point towards
``geoips.commandline.commandline_interface:main``, as that is how we start a process
workflow from now on.
