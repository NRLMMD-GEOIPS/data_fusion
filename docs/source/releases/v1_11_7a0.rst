===================

Update Data Fusion to use the 'output_checkers' interface
---------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#293: 2023-08-24, Create interface for compare outputs*

Update the data_fusion procflow to use the new geoips repo "output_checkers"
interface rather than the deprecated "compare_outputs" module.
