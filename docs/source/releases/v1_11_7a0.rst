Version 1.11.7a0 (2023-10-06)
*****************************

* Refactor: Update data_fusion to use 'output_checkers' interface.
* Bug Fixes: Update layered.yaml to include docstrings for each product plugins

Bug Fixes
=========

*Stems from issue GEOIPS#389: 2023-10-26, Make better use of the plugin registry*

With testing now added to the PluginRegistry class, we found an error in data_fusion
where the product plugin *layered.yaml* was missing docstrings for some of its
sub-products. This update fixes that issue, and adds docstrings to the plugins that were
missing them.

Refactoring Updates
===================

Update Data Fusion to use the 'output_checkers' interface
---------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#293: 2023-08-24, Create interface for compare outputs*

Update the data_fusion procflow to use the new geoips repo "output_checkers"
interface rather than the deprecated "compare_outputs" module.
