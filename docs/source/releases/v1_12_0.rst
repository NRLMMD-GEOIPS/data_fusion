Bug Fixes
=========

Call identify_checker and get_plugin separately for output_checkers
-------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#422: 2023-12-14, 1.12.0 release bug fixes*

* Call identify checker and get_plugin separately from procflows

  * Rather than having a special case in base.py get_plugin and
    output_checkers get_plugin which allowed passing in full paths
    to output products and automatically identifying the checker
    name and opening it, just explicitly call ``identify_checker``
    and ``get_plugin`` separately from the procflows.
  * single_source, config_based, and data_fusion procflows all now
    call ``identify_checker`` on the output product filename, and
    ``get_plugin`` on the resulting checker plugin name.
  * This simplified a lot of logic in both ``output_checkers`` and
    ``interfaces/base.py``. Supporting passing a filename to
    ``output_checkers.get_plugin()`` was unnecessarily complicated.
