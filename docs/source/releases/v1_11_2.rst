* resolve PDF build error

Bug Fixes
=========

resolve PDF build error
-----------------------

Build success with pdf build automatically completing and produces a PDF.
Resolved so PDF and html builds BOTH return zero, which equates to
error free.

The PDF build errors were caused by slightly mis-formatted RST docstrings
in some modules, mostly due to incorrectly formatted lists.  I am not
entirely sure why the flake8 RST docstring linting and the sphinx html
build both did not pick up on these formatting errors, but the sphinx
pdf build did.
