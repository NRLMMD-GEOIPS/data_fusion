Clean Up Optional Dependencies
------------------------------

Some GeoIPS readers include optional dependency statements that are required to read
certain file formats. While keeping these imports as optional is ok, we should clean
up the manner in which this is implemented. To do so, we've created a separate
geoips.testing.context_manager.py script which can handle optional imports scattered
throughout the GeoIPS codebase. This is essentially replacing our old manner of
optional dependencies with a new method that keeps things clean.
